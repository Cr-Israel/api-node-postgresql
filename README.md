<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Welcome to the API project built on Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL! This application is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with a PostgreSQL database through HTTP endpoints. Combining the power of Node.js, the ease of use of the Express framework, and the reliability of PostgreSQL, this project provides a solid foundation for creating and managing efficient and scalable APIs.</p>
<h2>Main Features</h2>
<p>
- Defined Routes: The project implements RESTful routes to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific resources. Each route is mapped to a corresponding controller, ensuring well-organized and maintainable code.

- Database Connection: We use PostgreSQL as our database management system. Through the appropriate driver library, we establish secure and efficient connections for storing and retrieving data.

- Middleware: Express.js allows us to implement middleware to handle requests before being directed to controllers. This allows for data validation, authentication, authorization, and other important functionality.

- JSON Responses: The API responds in JSON format, which makes it easy to integrate with different types of clients, such as web and mobile apps.
</p>

<h1>How to use?</h1>
<p>
- Prerequisites: Before starting, make sure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

- Database Configuration: Create a dotenv file in your directory and put the connectionString with your information.

- Installation of Dependencies: In the root directory of the project, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  - npm install
  - yarn install
- Running the Application: Start the API server with the following command:
  - npm start
  - yarn start
- Exploring the API: You can now access the API through http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified). See the documentation below for details on available endpoints and how to use them.

<h1>Endpoint Documentation</h1>
<p>Full documentation for API endpoints can be found at "http://localhost:5000/doc". Be sure to check supported methods, required parameters, and expected responses for each endpoint.</p>
